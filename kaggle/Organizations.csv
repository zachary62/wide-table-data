The U.S. Drought Monitor website is hosted and maintained by the NDMC.

U.S. Drought Monitor maps come out every Thursday morning at 8:30 Eastern Time, based on data through 7 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (8 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) the preceding Tuesday. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. Eleven climatologists from the partner organizations take turns serving as the lead author each week. The authors examine all the data and use their best judgment to reconcile any differences in what different sources are saying.

Countries around the world have sought to emulate the U.S. Drought Monitor. We stress that it isn’t a strictly quantitative product, and that the community of drought observers lends credibility to the state-of-the-art blend of science and subjectivity that goes into the map.

The U.S. Drought Monitor, a composite index that includes many indicators, is the drought map that policymakers and media use in discussions of drought and in allocating drought relief. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency used the U.S. Drought Monitor to distribute an estimated $1.64 billion from 2008 to 2011 through the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; $50 million in 2007 through the Livestock Assistance Grant Program; and additional funds through the Non-Fat Dry Milk Program in 2003 and 2004. The Internal Revenue Service also uses the U.S. Drought Monitor to determine the replacement period for livestock sold because of drought. As part of its response to the drought of 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture streamlined the process for secretarial disaster declarations, making declarations nearly automatic for a county shown in severe drought on the U.S. Drought Monitor for eight consecutive weeks."

United States Medicare is funded by a Payroll Tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disabilities status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as younger people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

In 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over 55 million—46 million people age 65 and older and nine million younger people. On average, Medicare covers about half of the health care charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. They might include the costs of uncovered services—such as for long-term, dental, hearing, and vision care—and supplemental insurance premiums."

Today's ethos of collaboration  has driven an open source movement to the benefit of practicioners as well as encouraging widespread participation in the data discovery process.  Nearly everyone is better off as a result of these innovations.

That is why I developed, ""Python for SAS Users"" located [here][1].
    
The goal is to provide a quick start for users familiar with the SAS lanaguage and enable them to become familiar with Python. The choice of which tool to utilize for any task typically comes down to a combination of what you as a user are familiar with and the context of the problem being solved.

The examples are a collect of Jupyter notebooks mapping SAS constructs and coding patterns into their Python equivalents. The primary focus is on panda and data management issues related to analysis of data.

"294","The Guardian","the-guardian","12/07/2016","The Guardian is a National British daily newspaper, known until 1959 as the Manchester Guardian. Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by The Scott Trust Limited. The Trust was created in 1936 ""to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference."" The Scott Trust became a limited company in 2008, with a constitution to maintain the same protections for The Guardian. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than to the benefit of an owner or shareholders.

The Guardian is edited by Katharine Viner, who succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. The newspaper has a UK online edition as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia and Guardian US. As of August 2013, The Guardian's print edition had an average daily circulation of roughly 189,000 copies, behind The Daily Telegraph and The Times, and ahead of The Independent. The newspaper's online edition was the fifth most widely read in the world as of October 2014, with over 42.6 million readers. In the UK, its combined print and online editions reach nearly 9 million readers."
"306","Parole Hearing Data Project","parole-hearing-data","12/08/2016","The Parole Hearing Data Project gathers New York State parole hearing data from the New York State Parole Board’s website and puts them in a consolidated spreadsheet, enabling research that would otherwise be much more laborious to perform. So far, it has enabled criminal justice research by graduate students at NYU's Engineering School as well as Columbia University's Journalism + Social Work Schools.  

In New York over 10,000 parole eligible prisoners are denied release every year, and while the consequences of these decisions are costly (at $60,000 annually to incarcerate one individual, and more to incarcerate older individuals with illnesses), the process of how these determinations are made is unclear.  Advocates for parole reform argue that parole commissioners too often base their decisions on ""the nature of the crime"" for which the individual was convicted, rather than on that individual's accomplishments and growth while serving  a sentence in prison.

The Parole Hearing Data Project was conceived by Nikki Zeichner, a former New York City-based criminal defense attorney who currently works on civic tech projects in San Francisco.  Nikki became interested in examining the NYS parole board's release practices while representing an incarcerated man in front of the NYS parole board for his tenth hearing. Despite having an excellent institutional record and sincere recommendations for release by prison staff, he had been denied parole release nine times and had served 18 years past his parole eligibility date. Nikki decided to prepare him for his next hearing on a pro bono basis and this time he was finally released. After serving 33 years in prison, he now lives with his family in Brooklyn, NY.  

The Parole Hearing Data Project is part of a broader body of work that can be found on the Museum of the American Prison's website."
"307","Federal Bureau of Investigation","fbi-us","12/08/2016","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.

Although many of the FBI's functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection overseas, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in lesser cities and areas across the nation. At an FBI field office, a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence.

Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe. These overseas offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries. The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas, just as the CIA has a limited domestic function; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies.

The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation (BOI). Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935. The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building, located in Washington, D.C."

The Seattle Public Library also founded, and until July 2008 administered, the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library (WTBBL).

All but one of Seattle's early purpose-built libraries were Carnegie libraries. Although the central Carnegie library has now twice been replaced, all the early 20th century purpose-built branches survive, although some have been subject to significant alterations. Ballard's former Carnegie library has held a number of restaurants, antique stores, etc., but the others (such as the Fremont Branch and Green Lake Branch) have been modernized, and remain in use as libraries.

"919","VoteView","voteview","08/10/2017","Voteview allows users to view every congressional roll call vote in American history on a map of the United States and on a liberal-conservative ideological map including information about the ideological positions of voting Senators and Representatives. The original Voteview of DOS was developed by Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal at Carnegie-Mellon University between 1989 and 1992. Poole and Rosenthal developed Voteview for Windows in 1993 at Princeton University and that work was continued by Boris Shor.

The new voteview.com combines the visualizations provided by the now obsolete Voteview desktop system, data and NOMINATE estimates provided by the old voteview.com web site, and up-to-date voting data from the current Congress with new search, download and visualization functionality.

Ideological positions are calculated using the DW-NOMINATE (Dynamic Weighted NOMINAl Three-step Estimation). This procedure was developed by Poole and Rosenthal in the 1980s and is a ""scaling procedure"", representing legislators on a spatial map. In this sense, a spatial map is much like a road map--the closeness of two legislators on the map shows how similar their voting records are. Using this measure of distance, DW-NOMINATE is able to recover the ""dimensions"" that inform congressional voting behavior.

The primary dimension through most of American history has been ""liberal"" vs. ""conservative"" (also referred to as ""left"" vs. ""right""). A second dimension picks up differences within the major political parties over slavery, currency, nativism, civil rights, and lifestyle issues during periods of American history.

The technical details of the DW-NOMINATE model can be found in Poole's Spatial Models of Parliamentary Voting. Poole and Rosenthal's Ideology and Congress explores the nature of voting in Congress and the political history of the United States through the lens of the ideological dimensions recovered by DW-NOMINATE and is a useful companion to this site."

Doc South Data provides access to some of the Documenting The American South collections in formats that work well with common text mining and data analysis tools.

Documenting the American South is one of the longest running digital publishing initiatives at the University of North Carolina. It was designed to give researchers digital access to some of the library’s unique collections in the form of high quality page scans as well as structured, corrected and machine readable text.

Doc South Data is an extension of this original goal and has been designed for researchers who want to use emerging technology to look for patterns across entire texts or compare patterns found in multiple texts. We have made it easy to use tools such as Voyant (http://voyant-tools.org/) to conduct simple word counts and frequency visualizations (such as word clouds) or to use other tools to perform more complex processes such as topic modeling, named-entity recognition or sentiment analysis.

CFTC Responsibilities

To promote market integrity, the CFTC polices the derivatives markets for various abuses. It also seeks to lower the risk of the futures and swaps markets to the economy and the public.
 
The agency oversees a variety of individuals and organizations. These include swap execution facilities, derivatives clearing organizations, designated contract markets, swap data repositories, swap dealers, futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, and other entities.
 
The Commission was established as an independent agency in 1974, assuming responsibilities that had previously belonged to the Department of Agriculture since the 1920s. The Commission historically has been charged by the CEA with regulatory authority over the commodity futures markets. These markets have existed since the 1860s, beginning with agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cotton.
 
Over time, these commodity futures markets, known as designated contract markets (DCMs) regulated by the Commission, have grown to include those for energy and metals commodities such as crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, copper, gold, and silver. The agency now also oversees DCMs for financial products such as interest rates, stock indexes, and foreign currency."

The Secretary of State works hand-in-hand with the business community. The office is tasked with recording the partnerships of who those who do business in Arizona and we register trade names, trademarks and issue certificates of registration. We also register telemarketers and veterans’ charitable organizations.

Improving the quality of life for Arizonans has been a priority of our office. The Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records (link is external) provides Arizonans access to information about their government, their state and their world. The information available from the State Library empowers citizens to become informed citizens.

Our Address Confidentiality Program allows victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse or stalking to keep their residential addresses confidential by giving them a substitute address.

Another important duty of the office is trustworthy, secure elections. The Secretary of State serves as Chief Election Officer for the State. One of the goals of the office is to register more voters and encourage them to become engaged in their elections. The office also certifies: voting devices, election results, candidates and measures to the ballot, as well as the results of statewide elections. In addition, we are the filing office for campaign finance and expenditure reports made by lobbyists.

Our office performs a variety of administrative functions as well. We grant or deny use of the Great Seal of the state of Arizona, attest to all official acts of the Governor and affix the Seal on all official documents. Our office commissions notaries and certifies notarized documents going to other states or foreign countries.

Citizens looking for information on legislative actions need to look no further than our office. We file chaptered bills, Senate and House memorials and resolutions and gubernatorial vetoes.

The duties of the Secretary of State are many, but our commitment to you remains the same: To provide you with efficient, friendly customer service."

---

Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations available. However, clinical diagnosis of a chest X-ray can be challenging and sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging. The lack of large publicly available datasets with annotations means it is still very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites with chest X-rays. One major hurdle in creating large X-ray image datasets is the lack resources for labeling so many images. Prior to the release of this dataset, [Openi][1] was the largest publicly available source of chest X-ray images with 4143 images available.

This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports. The labels are expected to be >90% accurate and suitable for weakly-supervised learning. The original radiology reports are not publicly available but you can find more details on the labeling process in the Open Access paper by [ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf][30]  (*Wang et al.*).

##About Statistics Canada

Statistics Canada produces statistics that help Canadians better understand their country—its population, resources, economy, society and culture.

In addition to conducting a Census every five years, there are about 350 active surveys on virtually all aspects of Canadian life.

In Canada, providing statistics is a federal responsibility. As Canada's central statistical office, Statistics Canada is legislated to serve this function for the whole of Canada and each of the provinces and territories.

Objective statistical information is vital to an open and democratic society. It provides a solid foundation for informed decisions by elected representatives, businesses, unions and non-profit organizations, as well as individual Canadians. As a member of the United Nations Statistical Commission, Statistics Canada endorses the Fundamental principles of official statistics.

OPHI aims to build and advance a more systematic methodological and economic framework for reducing multidimensional poverty, grounded in people’s experiences and values. OPHI works towards this by:

**Broadening poverty measurement**: OPHI develops and implements multi-dimensional measures of poverty, wellbeing and inequality. These measures go beyond traditional one-dimensional approaches to incorporate dimensions such as health, education, living standards, quality of work and more innovative dimensions.<br>

**Improving data on poverty**: OPHI has developed tools to measure five missing dimensions of poverty data that poor people value but which have been largely overlooked in international studies of poverty to date: Quality of Work, Empowerment, Physical Safety, The Ability to go About Without Shame, Psychological Wellbeing and Social Isolation.<br>

**Building capacity**: OPHI runs academic courses and technical training programmes on multidimensional poverty and human development, and collaborates with universities, development agencies, governments and other research institutions and policy makers using our work.<br>

**Impacting policy**: OPHI’s methodologies have been adopted by policy makers, including national governments and the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.<br>

OPHI’s work is grounded in Amartya Sen’s capability approach and works to implement this approach by creating real tools that inform policies to reduce poverty.<br>

OPHI’s team members are involved in a wide range of activities and collaborations around the world, including survey design and testing, quantitative and qualitative data collection, training and mentoring, and advising policy makers."

The digital world relies on data, and nobody produces more of it than China’s over 750 million Internet users. This massive volume of data provides significant advantages—more data powers more accurate predictive models, richer analysis, and more advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Since Chinese companies generate such a large amount of data each day, this data can be sorted and analyzed to make better business decisions. There are significant challenges, however, for traditional businesses to realize the value of big data when they transition from legacy systems to data-driven systems, like lacking data science talents , data security, and organizationl resistance . 

在中国拥有7.5亿网名，每天产生大量的数据，这些数据能够帮助我们获得更精准的模型，更先进的机器学习和深度学习技术。而中国的许多企业也逐渐意识到数据的重要性，通过分析数据来帮助企业做决策。但是在企业数字化转型的过程中往往会遇到很多的挑战比如数据人才的缺乏，数据安全以及来自传统组织架构的阻力。

Data is the lifeblood of the digital world, but learning how to use it requires human talent, insight, and creativity. And that is where you come in! We hope you enjoy working with these data sets, generating new insights, and coming up with exciting solutions.

The full name of FBP is FootBallPrediction, which has been predicted for 9 months. In the project, combined with big data and machine learning, we explored and developed a software. The software can predict the outcome of a football match (including winning and losing results) in multiple dimensions based on the odds offered by major gambling companies. At present, the accuracy rate can reach more than 80%, in the software version 1.0 and 2.0 version of the forecast results are 9 games in 11 and 11 games in 13, respectively. The current version of the software is 3.0, predicting eight of the nine matches from the start of the major football leagues on August 11, 2018 to August 20, 2018. The project has attracted more than 60 people in its own microblogging community, and most of them are betting on the predicted results every day, and each of them gains. Now I want to know more people of insight, together explore how to make the project bigger and stronger, find partners, to achieve a win-win situation. I hope the interested colleagues will contact me, micro signal acredjb. Subscriptions(or Official Accounts)is AI-FBP. AI-FBP predicts football game everyday. The Advantages of FBP are listed below.

1. The accuracy rate is high, reaching 80%.

2. Predition time is early, can be made 1 days ahead of FootBall Game schedule.

3. Not affected by personal emotions, the predition result is entirely exported by the program.

4. Do not be affected by trader's hand, ignore the change of the plate.

5. The prediction model is a process of ""iteration and correction of historical odds combination"", which conforms to 
the theory of back propagation algorithm in machine learning and predicts the result of large data odds combination.

6. Updating forecasting model data constantly, with the gradual increase of historical data, 
the accuracy will continue to improve,and stable in high accuracy.

7. Systematically describe predictive rules, process historical data, observe how predictions have behaved in the past, 
and then rationally improve these predictive rules according to specific results.

8. It will also incorporate new rules and predictive rules that may be overlooked by the program 
(e.g. program 1.0 only considers the odds of major spinach companies, program 2.0 adds dimension to the league, 
and program 3.0 adds periodic data as a new predictive rule).
At this point, the prediction ability of the program is much improved, more precise, faster, and free from emotional interference.

9. It is not blindly following the suggestion of procedure, but at the same time of procedure prediction, 
I also analyze (combining the basic aspects, especially the historical confrontation), and then compare the two. 
When the decision of the procedure is different from mine, I will check the reason.
